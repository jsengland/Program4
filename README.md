# Program4 README -> Jason England, 4/19/20

## 1. Program status (what works, what doesn't)
The only error that I had was getting the weight to actually matter when getting Pim's Min Spanning Tree.
Currently it acts as though all edges have no weight. I kept getting confused and could not figure it out.


## 2. Do you have quality code? 
/* See our coding guidelines, Javadoc, chunks, etc */
I do have spacing between my code and I do have JavaDocs and comments.



## 3. How to run your program
Place all files into a directory called "Program4"
then compile all java files and run Program04.



## 4. Creative element
I decided to make a pretty basic user Interface that lists all of the text files in the "graphs" directory.
It also allows the user to type what file they want to test and what starting vertex.



## 5. Other notes
The major problem I had was getting the weights to actually matter in the doPrims method. I tried fro a while and eventually
I just got to tired to continue working on the problem. Hopefully we can try to solve it together.
